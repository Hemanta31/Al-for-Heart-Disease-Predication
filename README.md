# Al-for-Heart-Disease-Predication
ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on key medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical parameters.

This system leverages data science techniques for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and classification modeling using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The final model is deployed via an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing healthcare practitioners or users to input patient data and receive real-time risk assessments.

The goal is to assist in early detection and support clinical decision-making, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.
